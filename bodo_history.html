It is a traditional dance which is traditionally inherent to one generation to another generations. The Bodo women perform the Bagurumba dance with their colourful dokhna, jwmgra (fasra) and aronai. The Bagurumba dance is accepted as main traditional dance of Bodo people. But there are some other important dances like- Bardwisikhla dance, Mwsaglangnai dance, Dahal-tungri sibnai dance, Sikri sikla dance, Daosri delai dance, Sa-gwlao mwsanai, Kopri sibnai mwsanai and so on. All these dances are known as Kristi dance. It is also accompanied by musical instruments like kham (a long drum, made of wood and goat skin or other animal’s skin), sifung (flute, made of bamboo), jota (made of iron/tama), serja (a bowed instrument, made of wood and animals skin), and gongwna (made of bamboo), tharkha (a piece of split bamboo).</p>

               	<p>This Bagurumba dance is originated from nature. Some thousands of years ago it was practiced by the Boro people. Generally Boro people like to stay in a green environment. They love to play with the environment, beauty of nature. So they used to stay in the foothills of the eastern and southern Himalayas, which are generally forest area. There are so many different symbols in this traditional dance, which are imitated from other natural environment. Like – dance of plants, dance of animals, birds, butterfly dance, wave of flowing river, wind etc.</p>

               	<p>By seeing this bagurumba dance, all Boro people can’t stay calm and quiet. By seeing this dance, suddenly every Bodo people use to dance unknowingly, and they feel peace and happiness in their mind.</p>
               	<p>There are no certain days and times to perform this dance; this dance can be performed on any occasion, festival and programme. At present Bagurumba dance is famous over the whole world.</p>

Most other regions prefer to either sun-dry ingredients or use oil as a preserving agent. While Gitika does not know where and how smoking as a practice originated amongst the Bodos, she says it is a common practice to see them smoke dried fish and pork chunks, which they then proceed to store in hollowed out bamboo stems. These are then hung over the fireplace in the kitchen to keep them from spoiling and getting mouldy, and also from miscreants stealing them!</P>

The Bodos also offer this brew to Lord Shiva during Baishagu, the festival when they welcome spring, as an offering. Till a few years ago, a guest of honour was always welcomed with a glass of Zou, because it was considered to have medicinal benefits due to various herbs that went in during its preparation and was even said to cure cholera. It is only in recent times that it is looked down upon as a potent intoxicant.</P>

Akin to chutneys, this is basically fermented fish chutney and it is said that one can predict which household is preparing Napham from a mile away – that is how strong its smell carries! Tiny pond fish are caught and fermented in January and then pounded with salt, crushed red chillies, some mustard oil and spices and stored to be eaten with rice and dal throughout the year.</P><p>Amongst meat, chicken (called Dau in Bodo) and pork (called Oma) are most favoured by Bodos, with most being inclined towards the latter. In fact Oma with black dal is a common preparation in most households and is made at least twice a week</p>
